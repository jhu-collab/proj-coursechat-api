# CourseChat API

## Overview

CourseChat API serves as the backend for the CourseChat application. It's constructed using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), a progressive Node.js framework designed for building efficient, scalable server-side applications. For readers unfamiliar with NestJS, you can delve deeper into its features and capabilities in the [official NestJS documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/).

## Description

CourseChat offers an interactive platform tailored to aid students in mastering their course material. Leveraging the prowess of OpenAI's GPT-4 model and augmented by retrieval-generated content specific to courses, CourseChat aims to be a modular platform. With its extensibility, it holds the potential to seamlessly integrate with other educational platforms in the future, enhancing the overall learning experience.

## Running the Application Locally

To get CourseChat API up and running on your local machine:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure Git, Node, and PNPM (the new package manager for Node) are installed. Additionally, Docker needs to be set up and running to spin up a local Postgres server. If you're new to Docker, [here's a helpful guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).
2. **Repository Setup**: Clone the repository and navigate to the root folder in the terminal.
3. **Dependencies**: Run `pnpm install`.
4. **Environment Configuration**: Add a `.env` file in the root folder, similar to `.env.example`, and fill in the required environment variables.
5. **Database Setup**: Run `pnpm docker:up` to initialize the Postgres server.

### Running the app

```bash
# development
$ pnpm run start

# watch mode
$ pnpm run start:dev

# production mode
$ pnpm run start:prod
```

**Tip**: Use the watch mode during development. It auto-refreshes upon detecting changes. Access the API at `http://localhost:3000` and view the Swagger UI documentation at `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`.

### Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ pnpm run test

# e2e tests
$ pnpm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ pnpm run test:cov
```

## Contributions

Contributing to CourseChat is simple and rewarding. Here's how you can be a part:

- **Identify a Change**: It can be a bug fix or an enhancement.
  - **Bug Fixes**: Raise a GitHub issue labeled `bug` detailing the issue.
  - **Enhancements**: Propose new features via a GitHub issue tagged `enhancement`.
  
- **Descriptive Titles**: Titles should be clear. For instance, "Fix Bug: API key not validating for `GET /assistants` endpoint" is preferable over a generic "Fix Bug."

- **Branch Creation**: 
  - For bug fixes, branch from the `main` branch.
  - For enhancements, use the `dev` branch as a base.
  - Stick to this naming convention for branches: `{author}-{type}-{name}`.

- **Code**: Commit frequently and push to the repository regularly.

- **Pull Request (PR)**: Once you're satisfied, raise a PR. Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the target branch (`main` or `dev`) to minimize conflicts.

- **Review**: Engage in the review process. Address feedback and iterate until your changes are approved.

- **Merging**: After approval, merge into the target branch. Merges from `dev` to `main` are handled by the team or tech lead.

- **Deployment**: It's automated, thanks to the CI/CD pipeline.

Remember, every contribution, big or small, goes a long way in refining CourseChat!
